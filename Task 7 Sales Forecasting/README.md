# 📈 Sales Forecasting  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project builds a **Sales Forecasting model** to predict future sales based on historical data.  
It applies **time series analysis and machine learning techniques** to capture sales trends and seasonality.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**  
  Cleans and prepares sales data for forecasting.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Identifies trends, seasonality, and correlations.  
- **Forecasting Models**  
  Implements models such as **ARIMA, Prophet, and Machine Learning regressors**.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**  
  Uses **MAE, RMSE, and MAPE** to measure forecast accuracy.

## 📂 Project Structure  
- `Task 7 Sales Forecasting.ipynb` → Main Colab-ready notebook  
- `data/` → Dataset containing historical sales records  

---

## 🛠️ Installation & Requirements  
Run in **Google Colab** (recommended). If running locally, install dependencies:  

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn statsmodels prophet
```

## ▶️ How to Use  

1. **Download the dataset** (e.g., Retail Sales Dataset or your custom sales data).  
2. **Place the dataset** in the working directory.  
3. **Open the notebook** in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.  
4. **Run the cells step by step:**  
   - Load and preprocess dataset  
   - Perform EDA and visualize sales patterns  
   - Train forecasting models  
   - Generate future sales predictions  
   - Evaluate results with error metrics

## 📊 Results  

- **ARIMA**: Works well for stationary data but struggles with complex seasonality.  
- **Prophet**: Captures trend and seasonality effectively with interpretable components.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Flexible, often achieve higher accuracy with feature engineering.
