# 🎵 Music Genre Classification  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project builds a **Music Genre Classification model** using audio feature datasets.  
It applies **machine learning techniques** to classify songs into different genres.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**  
  Handling and normalizing audio features for training.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Visualization of feature distributions and correlations.  
- **Machine Learning Models**  
  Trains models such as **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, and SVM**.  
- **Model Evaluation**  
  Uses **accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report** to measure performance.

## 📂 Project Structure  
- `Task 6 Music Genre Classification.ipynb` → Main Colab-ready notebook  
- `data/` → Dataset containing audio features and labels (genres)  

---

## 🛠️ Installation & Requirements  
Run in **Google Colab** (recommended). If running locally, install dependencies:  

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

---

## ▶️ How to Use  
1. Download the dataset (e.g., **GTZAN dataset** or Kaggle’s **Music Genre Dataset**).  
2. Place the dataset in the working directory.  
3. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** or Jupyter Notebook.  
4. Run the cells step by step:  
   - Load and preprocess dataset  
   - Explore dataset with visualizations  
   - Train machine learning models  
   - Evaluate performance and compare results

## 📊 Results  
- **Logistic Regression**: Performs well for linear feature separability.  
- **KNN**: Good for capturing local patterns, but sensitive to scaling.  
- **Random Forest**: Robust, handles feature importance well.  
- **SVM**: Strong classification performance with proper kernel tuning.
